# Live Trials

The task is to solve simple math expressions. The expressions are generated randomly.

Task shows suggested answer, player press 'Y' or 'N keys if the suggestion is correct or not.

Score is updated for successes and failures.

Workflow:
- the same as of [`trials_live`](../trials_live)
- trial is scheduled by 3 phases: aiming, showing task, responding
- also scheduling response timeout
