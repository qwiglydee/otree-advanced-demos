Runs series of trials on page.
The tasks are simple math expressions to solve.

- iteration is run by on-page scripts with synchronization with server
- trials data is pregenerated and embedded to the page
- responses are sent to server immediately
- performing validation (on back-end) and showing feedback for every response
- measuring precise reaction time of every response
- page is generally tolerant to reloading and navigating out
