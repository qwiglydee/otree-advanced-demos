# Local Trials

Runs series of trials on page.
The tasks are simple math expressions to solve.

- iteration is run by on-page scripts
- trials data is pregenerated and embedded to the page
- responses are submitted via hidden form field
- not revealing correct/best answers to the browser to make pages cheater-proof
- measuring total page time

Drawbacks:
- data is lost when navigating page out, reloading/back/forth
- no answer validation (because correct answers are not available)
