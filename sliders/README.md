# Sliders

Classic sliders task.

The page contains N randomly shifted sliders and the goal is to put them all in middle position.

- data for sliders is stored in separate data model individually
- sliders are pregenerated for a session and embedded into the page when it's loaded
- every slider move is saved to server in real time
- sliders are validated (on server) and highlighted when correct
- results for all sliders are available via custom export
- the page is generally tolerant to reloading and navigating out

Drawbacks:
- the page is vulnerable to cheating
