# Live Trials

The task is to solve simple math expressions. The expressions are generated randomly.

Answer is selected from provided choices.

On first stage player selects strategy to solve the task: 'choose', '50:50' or 'skip'.
In case of '50:50' number of choices is reduced.
In case of 'skip' the task is skipped.

Score is updated for successes, failures, skipping, and a penalty is taken for using '50:50'

Workflow:
- the same as of [`trials_live`](../trials_live)
