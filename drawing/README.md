# Drawing

The task is to solve a simple math expression and hand-write answer.

## Workflow

- Basically, same as of `trials_simple`
- Answer is taken from hand-drawn image
- Answers are not actually evaluated and scored
- Empty responses or responses with too few paint are not accepted and another retry is allowed

## Features

- input free-hand images
