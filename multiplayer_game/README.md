# Multiplayer Game

The task is just to type anything in a limited time.

Players who close their browser or hesitate for too long get dropped out from the game.

## Workflow

- Participants answer some questions in a separate screener app.
- Those who close the screener app are just ignored.
- Those who passes to the main app get grouped (by 2 or any other number).
- Participants just type any text.
- Those who wait too long get dropped out by page timeout and end up on a dead-end page.
- Those who close browser after the game started get dropped out.
- Payoff is a group bonus fund divided among players who left.
